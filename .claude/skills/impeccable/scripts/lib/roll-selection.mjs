// The one implementation of world-roll selection.
//
// Two copies of this logic used to exist: this repo's concept-seed.mjs and the
// service repo's functions/api/_worldroll-core.js, whose header claimed they
// matched "exactly". They did not. The API had no breadth gate on either pool,
// no rating weighting for compositions, and dealt one composition where the
// seeder dealt three. Because the catalog never ships with the skill, every real
// user rolls through that API, so those gates reached nobody.
//
// Why generators. The two callers cannot agree on a hash: Node has a
// synchronous one, Workers only have async crypto.subtle, and concept-seed's
// local render path is deliberately synchronous so prepared eval sessions and
// tests can call it without awaiting. Rather than fork the logic or force the
// whole seeder async, the selection is written once as a generator that yields
// batches of strings to hash and resumes with their digests. runSyncSelection
// and runAsyncSelection below are the only runtime-specific code, about eight
// lines each. Both digests are the same bytes, so a roll is identical either way.
//
// Nothing here reads a file, an environment variable, or the network: callers
// pass pools in.
